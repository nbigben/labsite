					<h3>From the Degradation of Oxidized Proteins to the Chemical Biology of Anti-Aging</h3>
					<p>Most living organisms use cellular respiration to generate energy to sustain life. The byproducts of cellular respiration are reactive free radicals which are dangerous for the cell. DNAs and proteins must be carefully protected against oxidative damages. Oxidized DNA needs to undergo repair, which is a well-studied process. On the other hand, most protein oxidation reactions are irreversible and damaged proteins must be degraded, but very little is understood about this process.</p>					
					<p>"The free radical theory of aging" states that cumulative oxidative damages are the molecular mechanisms of aging. Therefore the degradation of oxidized proteins is crucial to our understanding of aging.</p>
					<p>My lab is interested in understanding how the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) degrades oxidized proteins. The proteasome is the cell's major protease and the most important player in protein quality control. We will need to combine chemical biology, proteomics, and cell biology methods to understand the life cycle of oxidized proteins in the cell.<p>					
					<p>Many serious diseases in industrialized societies are age-related, including neurodegeneration, diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. In particular, Alzheimer's disease seems to be primarily caused by aging and is becoming one of the most costly health challenge in the world (some studies say Alzheimer's Disease is more expensive than cancer already). Alzheimer's disease is basically a proteomic disorder of the brain, characterized by the deposition of misfolded proteins (plaques and tangles). Although many antioxidants have been advertised as being protective against aging and other disorders, none of them have shown efficacy in clinical studies. We believe that a better understanding of the cellular defense against protein oxidation will eventually lead to better anti-aging strategies.</p>				
					<p>To summarize, our lab will have these initial focuses:
					<ol>
						<li>Degradation mechanisms of oxidized proteins</li> 
						<li>Proteasome composition and function</li>
						<li>Cellular antioxidant defense</li>
						<li>Interactome analysis by protein mass spectrometry</li>
						<li>Neurochemical changes at neuronal synapses in Alzheimer's disease</li>
					</ol></p>
