					<h3>Science of Antique Violins</h3>
					<p>In my spare time I also like to study antique violins made in Cremona, Italy, by such illustrious makers such as Amati, Stradivari, and Guarneri. To my own surprise, what started out as a hobby in graduate school has turned into a significant intellectual contribution to the world's violin community.</p>
					<p>For more than two centuries, many members have been trying to understand the "secrets of Stradivari" (and his equally amazing neighbor Guarneri <em>del Gesù</em>, DG). The mystery can be summarized into two major points: </p>					
					<p>1) The best sounding violins in the world, as determined by top soloists and collectors, are almost exclusively made by Stradivari and DG. But modern science has not been able to define their acoustic differences. So how do we characterize their superiority in an objective way? </p>			
					<p>2) Stradivari and DG violins must have sounded very unique even when they were just made, because many other equally old violins sound only mediocre today. So how did they do it? Why couldn't makers in other Italian cities, or the thousands of later makers who tried to copy Stradivari's work, make equally amazing violins even just by chance?</p>					
					<p>For the first question, I think it is now possible to measure and define the acoustic properties that put Strads and DGs in a league of their own. With the help of Chi Mei Museum in Taiwan, the world's leading collector of antique violins, we are currently investigating this issue using innovative approaches. We found that Stradivari violins produced formants similar to those of female voices, but other good violins produce more male-like formants. </p>					
					<p>For the second question, the answer probably lies in the material technology being incorporated into the wood and the varnish. I have written a comprehensive review on the chemical analysis of Stradivari's varnish, which has been widely read and appreciated by many of the leading violin makers in the world.</p>					
					<p>My violin research has led to several peer-reviewed articles:</p>
