					<h3>Dr. Bruce Hwan-Ching Tai</h3>
					<div><a class="download" href="./documents/Tai_CV_2011.pdf">Curriculum Vitae</a></div>
					<p>Hwan-Ching Tai was born and raised in Taiwan, but also lived in the US for a year during his childhood and picked up the nickname "Bruce." He received his BS in Chemistry at National Taiwan University in 2000.</p>
					<p>As PhD student at California Institute of Technology, he first worked in <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/research/investigators/hsieh-wilson_bio.html">Dr. Linda Hsieh-Wilson's group</a> on glycoprotein identification, and then in <a href="http://www.brain.mpg.de/research/schuman-department/director/">Dr. Erin Schuman's group</a> on synaptic plasticity. His doctoral thesis was on the characterization of proteasome complexes at the synapse, in collaboration with Dr. Alfred Goldberg at Harvard Medical School, who initially named the proteasome. After receiving his PhD in Chemistry in 2009, he became a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital, working with <a href="http://madrc.mgh.harvard.edu/bradley-t-hyman-md-phd">Dr. Bradley Hyman</a> on the synaptic biology of human Alzheimer's Disease.</p>
					<p>In addition to having a very broad scientific training that spans both chemistry and biomedical sciences, he is a self-taught expert on antique Italian violins and has published an influential article on the chemistry of Stradivari violins. You can read more about this in the <a href="./fun.html">For Fun</a> section.</p>
